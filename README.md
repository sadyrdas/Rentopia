# Prototypes of Rentopia
## Introduction
This is Bachelor Thesis in CTU. Author: Dastan Sadyraliyev
### Topic 
The rental of CTU dormitories is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of students, new students are often facing the
problem of discovering where and how to reserve a certain item or who to contact. The rental office has no information
system, everything is handled manually in the old-fashioned way.
The IS will cover a number of areas and a system built on microservices seems like a modern solution.
Gather the requirements on new IS with an emphasis on extensibility, performance, reliability, ease of use and scalability.
Create detailed wireframes for the new solution and validate the models.
Implement the core microservices and test the prototype.
